# billyprints
billyprints is a node based logic simulator inspired by the logisim project, made using dear imgui project. You can guess where the name idea came from.

## development 
It's in a may-break state of development, currently all fundamental operations are available, all logic gates have been added. Future versions will look into making the simulator more explorable and feature rich, with improved performance.
