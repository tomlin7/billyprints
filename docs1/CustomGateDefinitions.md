# Defining Custom Gates in Scripts

Billyprints allows you to define custom gates directly in your script using the `define...end` syntax. This is powerful for creating reusable logic blocks without switching to the visual editor.

## Basic Syntax

```
define GateName(input1, input2, ...) -> (output1, output2, ...):
  output1 = expression
  output2 = expression
end
```

## Primitive Operations

Only two operations are built-in primitives:

| Operation | Syntax | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| AND | `a AND b` | Output HIGH if both inputs HIGH |
| NOT | `NOT a` | Inverts the input signal |

All other gates must be built from these primitives or from previously defined/loaded custom gates.

## Tutorial 1: Building Basic Gates

### NAND Gate

NAND is simply AND followed by NOT:

```
define NAND(a, b) -> (out):
  t = a AND b
  out = NOT t
end
```

### OR Gate (De Morgan's Law)

OR can be built using: `OR(a,b) = NOT(NOT(a) AND NOT(b))`

```
define OR(a, b) -> (out):
  na = NOT a
  nb = NOT b
  t = na AND nb
  out = NOT t
end
```

### NOR Gate

NOR is OR followed by NOT, or equivalently: `NOR(a,b) = NOT(a) AND NOT(b)`

```
define NOR(a, b) -> (out):
  na = NOT a
  nb = NOT b
  out = na AND nb
end
```

### XOR Gate

XOR outputs HIGH when inputs are different: `XOR(a,b) = (a AND NOT(b)) OR (NOT(a) AND b)`

```
// First define OR (or load it from a library)
define OR(a, b) -> (out):
  na = NOT a
  nb = NOT b
  t = na AND nb
  out = NOT t
end

define XOR(a, b) -> (out):
  na = NOT a
  nb = NOT b
  t1 = a AND nb
  t2 = na AND b
  out = OR(t1, t2)
end
```

### XNOR Gate

XNOR is simply NOT(XOR):

```
define XNOR(a, b) -> (out):
  t = XOR(a, b)
  out = NOT t
end
```

## Tutorial 2: Building Arithmetic Circuits

### Half Adder

A half adder adds two bits and produces a sum and carry:
- Sum = A XOR B
- Carry = A AND B

```
// Assuming OR and XOR are already defined
define HalfAdder(a, b) -> (sum, carry):
  sum = XOR(a, b)
  carry = a AND b
end
```

### Full Adder

A full adder adds three bits (A, B, and Carry-in):

```
define FullAdder(a, b, cin) -> (sum, cout):
  // First half adder
  s1 = XOR(a, b)
  c1 = a AND b

  // Second half adder
  sum = XOR(s1, cin)
  c2 = s1 AND cin

  // Output carry
  cout = OR(c1, c2)
end
```

## Tutorial 3: Using Loaded Gate Libraries

You can use gates loaded from `.bin` files within your define blocks.

### Workflow

1. Load your gate library: **File > Load Custom Gates...**
2. Now you can reference those gates in your script

### Example

Assume you have a library with a `MUX2` (2-input multiplexer) gate:

```
// MUX2 was loaded from gates.bin
define MUX4(a, b, c, d, s0, s1) -> (out):
  // Use loaded MUX2 gates
  m1 = MUX2(a, b, s0)
  m2 = MUX2(c, d, s0)
  out = MUX2(m1, m2, s1)
end
```

---

## Tutorial 4: Multiple Outputs

Custom gates can have multiple outputs:

```
define Decoder2to4(a, b) -> (y0, y1, y2, y3):
  na = NOT a
  nb = NOT b
  y0 = na AND nb      // 00
  y1 = a AND nb       // 01
  y2 = na AND b       // 10
  y3 = a AND b        // 11
end
```

Using a multi-output gate:

```
Decoder2to4 dec @ 200, 100
In sel0 @ 50, 100
In sel1 @ 50, 200
Out led0 @ 400, 50
Out led1 @ 400, 150
Out led2 @ 400, 250
Out led3 @ 400, 350

sel0 -> dec.in0
sel1 -> dec.in1
dec.out0 -> led0
dec.out1 -> led1
dec.out2 -> led2
dec.out3 -> led3
```

## Rules and Limitations

### Signal Names
- Must be valid identifiers (letters, numbers, underscores)
- Case-sensitive
- Cannot use reserved words: `define`, `end`, `AND`, `NOT`

### Order Matters
- Gates must be defined **before** they are used
- Input/output order in the signature determines slot numbering (`in0`, `in1`, `out0`, `out1`)

### No Nested Calls
This is **NOT** allowed:
```
// WRONG - nested calls
out = NAND(NAND(a, a), NAND(b, b))
```

Use intermediate signals instead:
```
// CORRECT - intermediate signals
t1 = NAND(a, a)
t2 = NAND(b, b)
out = NAND(t1, t2)
```

### No Feedback Loops
Define blocks create combinational logic only. You cannot create feedback loops within a define block.
