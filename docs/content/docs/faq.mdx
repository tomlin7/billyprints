# Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What gates are built-in?">
    Billyprints includes only the fundamental gates:
    - **AND** - Output HIGH if both inputs HIGH
    - **NOT** - Inverts the input
    - **In** - Interactive input (switch/button)
    - **Out** - Visual output (LED)

    All other gates (OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR) can be built from AND and NOT using Boolean algebra, or loaded from gate libraries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why only AND and NOT as primitives?">
    AND and NOT together form a **functionally complete** set - any Boolean function can be expressed using just these two operations. This teaches the fundamental principle that complex digital systems are built from simple primitives.

    You can define all other gates:
    ```
    // OR from AND and NOT (De Morgan's Law)
    define OR(a, b) -> (out):
      out = NOT (NOT a AND NOT b)
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create sequential circuits (flip-flops, latches)?">
    Yes! You can create feedback loops by connecting outputs back to inputs. The simulator handles propagation in steps.

    ```
    // SR Latch using NOR gates
    NOR nor1 @ 200, 100
    NOR nor2 @ 200, 200

    nor2.out -> nor1.in1
    nor1.out -> nor2.in1
    ```

    <Callout type="warn">
      Be careful with feedback loops - they can cause oscillation if not designed correctly.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to circuit complexity?">
    There's no hardcoded limit on:
    - Number of nodes
    - Nesting depth of custom gates
    - Number of connections

    Practical limits depend on your system's memory and CPU. Circuits with tens of thousands of nodes work fine on modern hardware.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I save my circuits?">
    Yes! Use **File > Save Scene** (`Ctrl+S`) to save your circuit as a `.bps` file.

    To save custom gates for reuse, use **File > Save Custom Gates** to create a `.bin` library file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are my custom gates showing as placeholders?">
    This happens when you open a scene that uses custom gates that aren't loaded in memory.

    **Solution:** Load the gate library (`.bin` file) before opening the scene, or click the **Load Library...** button in the warning banner.

    See [Gate Libraries](/docs/gate-libraries) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this for learning digital logic?">
    Absolutely! Billyprints is designed as an educational tool. You can:
    - Visualize how gates work
    - Build circuits from first principles
    - Understand Boolean algebra
    - Design combinational and sequential circuits
    - Even build a simple CPU!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What platforms are supported?">
    Currently **Windows only** (Windows 10/11).

    macOS and Linux support is planned for future releases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Billyprints open source?">
    Yes! Billyprints is built with:
    - C++ for core logic
    - ImGui for the user interface
    - ImNodes (modified fork) for the node graph
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I report bugs or request features?">
    Please open an issue on the GitHub repository with:
    - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
    - Expected vs actual behavior
    - Screenshots if applicable
  </Accordion>
