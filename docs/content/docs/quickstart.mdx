# Quick Start

Get a working circuit running in under a minute.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open Billyprints

    Launch the application. You'll see an empty canvas with a script editor on the right.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Paste this script

    Copy and paste this into the script editor:

    ```
    In A @ 100, 100
    In B @ 100, 200
    AND gate @ 250, 150
    Out LED @ 400, 150

    A -> gate.in0
    B -> gate.in1
    gate -> LED
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Click Apply

    Press the **Apply** button (or refresh icon) in the script editor.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Test your circuit

    Click on the **A** and **B** input nodes to toggle them. The LED lights up when both are ON!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
Congratulations! You've built an AND gate circuit. Both inputs must be HIGH for the output to be HIGH.
</Callout>

## What Just Happened?

| Line | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `In A @ 100, 100` | Create an input switch named "A" at position (100, 100) |
| `In B @ 100, 200` | Create an input switch named "B" at position (100, 200) |
| `AND gate @ 250, 150` | Create an AND gate named "gate" at position (250, 150) |
| `Out LED @ 400, 150` | Create an output LED named "LED" at position (400, 150) |
| `A -> gate.in0` | Connect A's output to gate's first input |
| `B -> gate.in1` | Connect B's output to gate's second input |
| `gate -> LED` | Connect gate's output to the LED |

## Try These Variations

### NOT Gate (Inverter)

```
In switch @ 100, 100
NOT inverter @ 250, 100
Out LED @ 400, 100

switch -> inverter -> LED
```

### OR Gate (using NAND gates)

```
define OR(a, b) -> (out):
  na = NOT a
  nb = NOT b
  t = na AND nb
  out = NOT t
end

In A @ 100, 100
In B @ 100, 200
OR gate @ 250, 150
Out LED @ 400, 150

A -> gate.in0
B -> gate.in1
gate -> LED
```
