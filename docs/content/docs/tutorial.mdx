This tutorial will guide you through creating a simple interactive circuit using the script editor. We will build a basic **Logic Tester** that lights up an LED when two buttons are pressed.

<Callout title="Prerequisites" type="info">
Make sure you have Billyprints installed. See the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide if needed.
</Callout>

## Building an AND Gate Circuit

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open the Script Editor

    Launch Billyprints. If the script editor on the right is collapsed, click the `<` button at the top-right corner to expand it.

    <Callout type="tip">
      You can also press `Tab` to toggle the script editor.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add Components

    In the script editor, we'll define our components. We need:
    - Two switches (Inputs)
    - One AND gate
    - One LED (Output)

    Clear any existing script and paste:

    ```
    In switch1 @ 100, 100
    In switch2 @ 100, 250
    AND logic @ 300, 175
    Out led @ 500, 175
    ```

    Click **Apply** (or the refresh icon). Four nodes should appear on the canvas.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Connect the Wires

    Now we tell the signals where to flow. Add these lines to connect:
    - `switch1` and `switch2` to the `logic` gate inputs
    - The `logic` output to the `led`

    ```
    switch1.out -> logic.in0
    switch2.out -> logic.in1
    logic.out -> led.in
    ```

    Click **Apply**. Wires now connect your nodes!
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Test Your Circuit!

    1. Click the button inside **switch1** — it toggles to **ON**
    2. The LED is still **OFF** (AND requires both inputs HIGH)
    3. Click **switch2** to toggle it **ON**
    4. The LED lights up! Both inputs are HIGH.

    <Callout type="success">
      Congratulations! You've built a working AND gate circuit.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Script

Here's the full script for reference:

```
In switch1 @ 100, 100
In switch2 @ 100, 250
AND logic @ 300, 175
Out led @ 500, 175

switch1.out -> logic.in0
switch2.out -> logic.in1
logic.out -> led.in
```

## Variations

<Tabs items={['Momentary Buttons', 'NOT Gate', 'Custom OR Gate']}>
  <Tab value="Momentary Buttons">
    ### Momentary Push Buttons

    Want buttons that only stay ON while held? Add the `momentary` flag:

    ```
    In switch1 @ 100, 100 momentary
    In switch2 @ 100, 250 momentary
    AND logic @ 300, 175
    Out led @ 500, 175

    switch1.out -> logic.in0
    switch2.out -> logic.in1
    logic.out -> led.in
    ```

    Now buttons show **PUSH** and only send a signal while clicked.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="NOT Gate">
    ### Simple Inverter

    A NOT gate inverts the input signal:

    ```
    In switch @ 100, 100
    NOT inverter @ 250, 100
    Out led @ 400, 100

    switch -> inverter -> led
    ```

    When the switch is OFF, the LED is ON (and vice versa).
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Custom OR Gate">
    ### Building an OR Gate

    Since only AND and NOT are built-in, let's build OR using De Morgan's Law:

    ```
    // Define OR: NOT(NOT(a) AND NOT(b))
    define OR(a, b) -> (out):
      na = NOT a
      nb = NOT b
      t = na AND nb
      out = NOT t
    end

    // Use it
    In switch1 @ 100, 100
    In switch2 @ 100, 250
    OR logic @ 300, 175
    Out led @ 500, 175

    switch1 -> logic.in0
    switch2 -> logic.in1
    logic -> led
    ```

    The LED lights up when **either** switch is ON.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding the Syntax

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `In name @ x, y` | Create an input switch at position (x, y) |
| `Out name @ x, y` | Create an output LED at position (x, y) |
| `AND name @ x, y` | Create an AND gate at position (x, y) |
| `NOT name @ x, y` | Create a NOT gate at position (x, y) |
| `a.out -> b.in` | Connect a's output to b's input |
| `momentary` | Makes input a push-button instead of toggle |
