# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## Script Errors

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="'Unknown type' error">
    **Symptom:** Error message like `Unknown type: XOR`

    **Cause:** You're trying to use a gate that hasn't been defined or loaded.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Define the gate before using it:
    ```
    define XOR(a, b) -> (out):
      // ... definition
    end

    XOR mygate @ 100, 100  // Now this works
    ```

    2. Or load a gate library that contains the gate (**File > Load Custom Gates**)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Duplicate identifier' error">
    **Symptom:** Error message about duplicate node names

    **Cause:** Two nodes have the same identifier.

    **Solution:** Use unique names for each node:
    ```
    // Wrong
    AND gate @ 100, 100
    AND gate @ 200, 100  // Duplicate!

    // Correct
    AND gate1 @ 100, 100
    AND gate2 @ 200, 100
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Invalid slot' error">
    **Symptom:** Error when creating connections

    **Cause:** Referencing a slot that doesn't exist on the node.

    **Solution:** Check the slot names for your node type:
    - `In` nodes have: `out`
    - `Out` nodes have: `in`
    - `AND` gates have: `in0`, `in1`, `out`
    - `NOT` gates have: `in`, `out`
    - Custom gates use: `in0`, `in1`, ... and `out0`, `out1`, ...
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Script changes not applying">
    **Symptom:** Editing the script doesn't update the canvas

    **Solution:**
    1. Make sure you click **Apply** (or the refresh icon)
    2. Check for syntax errors in the script
    3. Look for error messages at the bottom of the script editor
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Circuit Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Circuit not simulating correctly">
    **Symptom:** Outputs don't match expected behavior

    **Possible causes:**
    1. **Missing connections** - Check that all inputs are connected
    2. **Wrong slot** - Verify you connected to the correct input slot
    3. **Logic error** - Review your gate definitions

    **Debug tips:**
    - Add `Out` nodes to intermediate signals to see their values
    - Simplify the circuit and test each part separately
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Feedback loop causing oscillation">
    **Symptom:** Circuit rapidly toggles or behaves erratically

    **Cause:** Unstable feedback loop (e.g., `NOT` feeding back into itself)

    **Solutions:**
    1. Add a gating signal to control when feedback occurs
    2. Use proper latch/flip-flop designs
    3. Add an enable input to break the loop when needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance slowdown with large circuits">
    **Symptom:** UI becomes sluggish with many nodes

    **Solutions:**
    1. Group related logic into custom gates to reduce visible nodes
    2. Close unused panels (script editor, dock)
    3. Avoid unnecessary visual updates by zooming out

    <Callout type="info">
      The simulation itself is optimized with caching. Visual rendering is usually the bottleneck.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## File Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Custom gates showing as placeholders (red nodes)">
    **Symptom:** Nodes appear red with "?" prefix after loading a scene

    **Cause:** Scene uses custom gates that aren't loaded in memory.

    **Solution:**
    1. Click **Load Library...** in the warning banner
    2. Select the correct `.bin` file
    3. Placeholders will automatically convert to real gates

    <Callout type="tip">
      Always load gate libraries **before** opening scenes that use them.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't open old scene files">
    **Symptom:** Error loading a `.bps` file

    **Possible causes:**
    1. File corruption
    2. Scene uses gates from an unavailable library

    **Solutions:**
    1. Try loading any required gate libraries first
    2. Check if the file was saved with a newer version
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gates not saving to library">
    **Symptom:** Custom gates disappear after restart

    **Cause:** Gates exist only in memory until explicitly saved.

    **Solution:** Use **File > Save Custom Gates** to save your gates to a `.bin` file.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Display Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Nodes or connections not rendering">
    **Symptom:** Parts of the circuit are invisible

    **Solutions:**
    1. Press `Home` to reset the view
    2. Press `F` to frame all nodes
    3. Check if nodes are positioned far outside the visible area
    4. Try restarting the application
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="UI text is too small/large">
    **Symptom:** Interface elements are hard to read

    **Solutions:**
    1. Adjust your system DPI settings
    2. Use zoom controls (`+`/`-`) for the canvas
    3. Check your monitor scaling settings
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Still Stuck?

If you can't find a solution here:

1. Check the [FAQ](/docs/faq) for common questions
2. Review the [DSL Reference](/docs/dsl-reference) for syntax help
3. Look at [Examples](/docs/examples) for working circuit patterns
4. Open an issue on GitHub with detailed reproduction steps
